- On to scraping the individual moves of each Pokemon...
 -- pokemon_db_scrape.ipynb at the bottom has the strategy we should try in bulk:
1. Go through each Pokemon from pokemon_main_stats.csv (need to look into dupes like charizard y etc.)
2. Grab the first gen that pokemon appeared in (see last scrape)
3. Loop through each url for that pokemon appended to their first url
 - e.g. https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/bulbasaur/moves/1
 -      https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/inteleon/moves/8
4. Scrape that move list (their original moves)
 - see scraping method above 3.
 - also need to unique this list? Might have dupes (e.g. red/blue + yellow are all gen 1 but have two separate tabs)
5. Link that together with pokemon_moves_data.csv during the pick_em to get all the move stats for the randomly selected move for that turn
